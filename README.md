# bookUP
This is *bookUP*. *bookUP* is a client-side web app that enables users to look up and find the next book they desire to read. *bookUP* implements the Google Books 
API via the Fetch API method. If you are in need of a new read, try *bookUP*!

# Home Page
The home page was created to be responsive depending on the size of the user's browser window. Examples are shown below.

# Lookup Page
The Lookup page is the bread and butter of this web app. Here, users are able to lookup the title of a book and the top ten search results will be displayed on the 
screen. A search result displays five properties of the book being searched: an image of the book, the title, author(s), genre(s), and synopsis. The search results 
are displayed via Flex, so the search result elements are naturally responsive to the user's browser window. Examples are shown below. *Note: The last two images only show the first two (out of ten) search results.*
